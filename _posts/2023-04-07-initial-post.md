I've been interacting with Large Language Models for quite some time, and since the arrival of GPT-4, I've been awestruck.

Driven by a desire to better understand the impact these developments will have on society as a whole and my personal life as a self-proclaimed lifelong learner, I came up with a lighthearted experiment based on the "AI-generated, Human-curated" concept I've seen shared on forums like Reddit.

The experiment involves taking this concept and testing its merit when applied to one of humanity's most iconic symbols of knowledge: a written book. This quirky project will serve as a personal journey to better comprehend how these technologies change our relationship with knowledge and our understanding of the world around us.

What better subject for the AI to "write" about than education!

I hope this will prove valuable or, at the very least, provide a good laugh.

PS, written by me, curated by GPT-4 for readability.
